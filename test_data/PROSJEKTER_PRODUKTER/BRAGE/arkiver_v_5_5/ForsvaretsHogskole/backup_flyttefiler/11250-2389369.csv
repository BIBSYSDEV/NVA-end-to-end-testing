The thesis’ necessarily interdisciplinary research design thus carries a significant maritime disposition as its analysis is primarily one of maritime thinking and its interfaces with political and military strategy. To that end, the theoretical and analytical framework combines elements of naval theory and Civil-Military Relations (CMR) in order to prescribe proper conceptual tools aiding its study while employing Comparative Historical Analysis (CHA) allowing longitudinal comparison of within-variation and its analytical tool of process-tracing aiding causal inference from probing for continuity and change in Russian maritime defence planning and seapower.
What becomes evident in sum is how the North has figured prominently throughout with an increased prominence prescribed to the Russian Federation Navy (RFN) and maritime strategy in national frameworks. Whereas Russian threat perceptions have fuelled military modernisation and reforms focusing on combat capability, boesposobnost, and combat readiness, boegotovnost, in line with a shift to Network-Enabled Capability (NEC), strategic thinking and operational art demonstrates significant continuity through the inherently asymmetric, universal and continuous concept of “strategic deterrence”, strategischeskoe sderzhivanie, in deterring, containing and coercing in times of peace, crisis and war—to which Norwegian territory lend itself of particular use while exposing Norway and NATO to significant power-wielding in differing ways.
As the principal objective of naval rearmament, what emerges from Russian maritime defence planning and seapower is a naval force whose seapower is restrained to coastal defence and power projection in adjacent seas with an enhanced capacity for sea control and sea denial—the sum of which in the North manifests as an “arc of steel” with significant strategic and operational implications for Norwegian maritime strategy. Critically, Russian defence planner’s preoccupation with the strategic deterrence concept and a regime of Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) and precision-guided munitions (PGM) to support it has solidified the Royal Norwegian Navy’s (RNoN) need for forward-based presence based on an operational approach of area-access employing the fleet’s mobility and firepower, while increasing its dependence upon the exploitation of the coastline for survivability and as a force multiplier in order to fulfil the tasks set by the maritime strategy— demanding coastal defence capabilities and sufficient degrees of sea denial and sea control cross spectrum.",,"http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2503208",,"eng","Universitetet i Bergen","The Author","133","VDP::Samfunnsvitenskap: 200::Statsvitenskap og organisasjonsteori: 240::Sammenlignende politikk: 241",,"Defence planning||Seapower||Strategic thinking||Operational Art||Naval structure||The Russian Federation Navy||The Royal Norwegian Navy||Norwegian maritime strategy","“Strategic Deterrence” in the North.

All naval units spend much time and effort to navigate faster, safer and tactically clever. For decades radar has been the most important tool to ensure navigation at an acceptable risk level. 

After the introduction of computer based integrated bridge systems, it was possible to give the navigators a new set of tools, and it was technologically possible to do things faster and with a higher level of automation and precision. However, the introduction of new technology did not only lead to a safer and more efficient navigation. The statistics revealed that during the last decade, collisions still happened at approximately the same frequency. Most of the collisions reports express that violations of “the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea” (COLREG) occur. The reports also describe incorrect use of radar and AIS and lack of understanding of the systems. 
In addition to visual evaluation, radar and AIS are the most important aids to avoid a collision. The radar is well known, but has been constantly developed. Even if AIS is relatively new, most ships have installed it, but it is not always taken maximum advantage of. 

In order to investigate how radar and AIS are utilised in the Norwegian navy, the fieldwork consisted of observation of live navigation on board the Skjold class and in the simulator at NNC. In addition 19 officers were interviewed by means of a questionnaire to evaluate the level of knowledge within radar and AIS. 

The findings indicate that all the different aids provided in an IBS to avoid collisions are not fully understood and not fully utilised. Some automatic functions are never used and hardly ever explored. Visual observations were the most important and most used input factors to create a SA before decisions were made. The electronic information provided by radar and AIS was not always utilised to achieve an optimal SA. 
However, all potential collisions incidents in the field tests were handled in a professional and safe way.","Project thesis submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science - Positioning and Navigation Technology, The University of Nottingham.","http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2499421",,"eng",,"Forfatteren","89","VDP::Technology: 500",,"Navigasjon||Radar","The use of radar and AIS in anti-collision on a modern IBS in the Norwegian Navy","Master thesis"

Since 2011, there have been two fully operational GNSS systems – GPS since 1995 and GLONASS since 2011. Both GPS and GLONASS conduct modernization programs involving new satellites, new signals and new ground segment stations. New GNSS equipment is needed to exploit the new signals and both GNSS systems in a combined positioning approach. Future GNSS systems are Galileo and BeiDou.
The Northeast Passage (NEP) is the shipping route between Europe and Asia passing Norwegian and Russian territory. The NEP is about 40% shorter than the voyage through Suez channel. The reduction of sea ice in the arctic area around Svalbard and NEP has increased the use of NEP for civilian vessels. The cold and harsh environment in NEP demands robust and reliable navigation equipment for solving position solutions. The distinctiveness of the Arctic is the latitude. It is higher than the inclination angle to Equator of the GNSS satellites orbital planes and the arctic area has ionospheric irregularities due to Aurora Borealis.
In the thesis, a GNSS measurement was conducted at Svalbard on 16 to 18 June 2015. The aim of the research is to compare the GNSS combinations positioning approach: GPS Single, GLONASS, GPS Dual, GPS+GLONASS combined and DGPS.
The RTKLIB version 2.4.3, an open source GNSS processing software program was used to evaluate the solutions of the GNSS combinations by post-processing the data collected at Svalbard. The research compared the GNSS combinations in a long and short static test, in a dynamic ship moving simulation and during sun activity.
The GPS+GLONASS combination has shown to be more robust in accuracy, precision, availability of all GNSS satellites and their signals during the static and dynamic test in the Arctic. Due to redundancy and robustness, it is advantageous to use the GPS+GLONASS combination for safe navigation in the arctic area around Svalbard and in the Northeast Passage for civilian vessels.","Project thesis submitted to the University of Nottingham in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science in Positioning and Navigational Technology",,"http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2389386","eng",,,"110","VDP::Technology: 500","GLONASS||Arktis||Nordøstpassasjen||GPS single receiver||GPS dual receiver||DGPS receiver||GPS+GLONASS receiver||GNSS feilkilder||RTKLIB 2.4.3||DOP||Accuracy||Precision||Signal to Noise Ratio||SNR||Skyplot||Multipath||Number of satellites||Moving GNSS antenna","Satelittnavigasjon||GPS||GNSS","Civil maritime GNSS combinations in arctic areas","Master thesis"

A Submarine must be able to solve a wide range of operations, from peacetime engagements to war-scenarios. In order to conduct all types of operations the demand for precise navigation is high.
In addition to navigation, does the positioning system also updates the Command & Control- and weapon system.
The employment of both Submarines and surface ships are affected by the physical environment and weather conditions. Operating in a deep open ocean poses different challenges then operating close to shore, or in the littorals.
The high accuracy requirements combined with the need for covered submerged operations is a challenge when it comes to design of the Navigation systems for Submarines. As surface ships have a continued GNSS access, the Submarines does not. There are several techniques and modes of navigating a Submarine submerged (Terrestrial, optical (periscope), use of depth counters, Navigation Sonar etc). However, Dead reckoning by an accurate INS (Inertial Navigation System) is the main navigation method. The INS provides high bandwidth and precision attitude, with sensor quality varying with the size of the submarine and mission length.
The Submarine might be forced to go deep before a proper GNSS fix is obtained. There are mainly two reasons for this: Either to stay undetected (Tactical issue), or in order to avoid a collision (Safety issue). In these cases there will be an inaccurate update of the INS.
The study aims at determining the challenges and consequences of a poor position update of a Submarine INS in the littorals. For this purpose, analyses have been conducted in Inertial Explorer and Excel.
Comparing the position accuracy of different manipulated position updates showed that both different standard errors and position errors affects the performance of the INS/IMU. Some of the trials showed the multipath sometimes have a positive effect on the absolute accuracy.
The INS/IMU complies well with GNSS-updates, even with a few epochs
The analysis showed that it is challenging to the INS/IMU to navigate for long periods without GNSS-input, what is the case for a Submarine.","Project Submitted to the University of Nottingham in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science in Positioning and Navigation Technology",,"http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2389390","eng",,,"160","VDP::Technology: 500",,"Ubåter||Navigasjon","Challenges and consequences of a poor position update of a submarine INS in the littorals","Master thesis"

Technology for jamming is easily available, and in recent years there have been many cases of intentional jamming.
As GPS is the principal means of position fixing used by the Norwegian Navy, important questions to find answers to is how vulnerable the GPS and the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) are to a jamming attack, and further whether employing the Glonass satellite system in addition to GPS will provide better performance regarding robustness and redundancy when receivers are exposed to jamming. By having a Coast Guard Vessel operating inshore the Norwegian fjords as case, this research aims to explore these issues and it does so by asking the following research questions:

- Will employing Glonass in addition to GPS provide better performance in Northern areas when the systems are exposed to GNSS jammers?

- How is the ability of the existing GPS system on board a Norwegian Coastguard Vessel to provide a reliable position when there is a jamming threat, and how will the ECDIS system on board handle an eventually loss of GPS position?

The study consists of two jamming tests: A static test where focus is to analyze and compare the GPS and Glonass system and a dynamic test where the GPS and ECDIS system on board is analyzed when exposed to jamming.
The results from the static test showed that the jammer has effect on large distances, and that the different receivers used react differently when exposed to jamming. Further, the carrier-to-noise ratios for Glonass are less affected by the jammer, and the receiver is able to track Glonass satellites with lower carrier-to-noise ratios than GPS satellites. We have seen that utilizing Glonass satellites in addition to GPS satellites in the receiver contribute to a later loss of position fix and an earlier calculation of new position under difficult jamming conditions.
The dynamic test showed that the marine grade GPS receiver is easy to jam. A weak jamming signal caused the GPS receivers to give misleading information without any warning from itself or the ECDIS system. The ECDIS system provided an adequate DR positioning, but there are issues that need to be resolved for better functionality.
As Glonass signals has shown to be more resistant to jamming than GPS signals, applying the Glonass system in addition to GPS might provide benefits with regards to reliability and redundancy, especially for maritime navigation in Northern areas where the Glonass satellites also have higher elevation and better coverage than GPS.","Project thesis submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Positioning and Navigation Technology, The University of Nottingham.",,"http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2389675","eng",,"Forfatteren","79","VDP::Technology: 500","GNSS||GPS||ECDIS||Navigasjon||GLONASS",,"Jamming of GPS & GLONASS signals - a study of GPS performance in maritime environments under jamming conditions, and benefits of applying GLONASS in Northern areas under such conditions","Master thesis"

The paradigm shift from paper charts to electronic charts has been a technological leap for mariners, and the Integrated Navigation Systems (INS) are getting more and more complex. This leads to new challenges for the navigators of today.
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS are the primary position sensor input for ECDIS, and it has since its early beginning in the middle of the 1990s been very reliable. National and worldwide statistics show that there has been a slight increase in navigational accidents since the introduction of ECDIS, but the reasons for this is not clear. In the literature review it is laid down that position sensors have its potential fault, and GNSS and its augmentation systems is described to better understand its advantageous and limitations. Control of ECDIS with position control methods are explored, and divided into two methods of control: Visual- and Conventional methods.
Through field work, simulator tests and interviews the findings are clear. The navigators of today rely too much upon their primary position sensor which normally is a GNSS such as GPS. A questionnaire reveals that the navigators have insufficient deeper system knowledge of the navigation aids in use. This can lead to a potentially serious accident with loss of lives and large environmental damage. To achieve safe navigation it is important to continuously conduct control of primary position sensor input to ECDIS with a secondary position sensor by visual- and/or conventional control methods. The advantages and limitations with the different methods of control are discussed. Position sensors such as GNSS can fail, and navigators of today and tomorrow need to monitor the position sensor input to ECDIS with other means than GNSS.","Project thesis submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Position and Navigation Technology at The University of Nottingham",,"http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2395028","eng",,,"134","VDP::Technology: 500",,,"Control of position sensor input to Ecdis on high speed craft","Master thesis"

Det har i løpet av de siste årene vært stort frafall av personell, utover det som kan tillegges normal og tilfeldig avgang. I løpet av de siste årene har MTB-våpenet vært gjennom et paradigmeskifte i forbindelse med innfasingen av den nye Skjold-klassen, og utfasingen av den gamle Hauk-klassen. I denne omstillingsprosessen har det vært overraskende stor tålmodighet blant personell, og avgangsprosenten har ikke vært så høy som en kanskje har forventet på tross av forsinkelser og lediggang.
Fra og med 2010 har vi sett en markant økning i antall avganger fra MTB-våpenet. Det har vært mye diskutert i arbeidsmiljøet om hva som skal til for at personell blir værende i sin stilling og hva som skal til for å stanse den negative trenden innenfor personellsituasjonen generelt i Sjøforsvaret, og da kanskje spesielt i MTB-våpenet.
I løpet av vår tid i MTB-våpenet har vi opparbeidet stor bruksteori innenfor temaet, da dette er noe som har engasjert oss og våre medarbeidere i flere år. Gjennom teorien vi har tilegnet oss under masterstudiet Endringsledelse har vi en god teoretisk plattform i forhold til temaet.
Metoden vi har brukt er en blanding av kvantitative og kvalitative studier, med hovedvekt på kvalitativ metode i form av intervjuer av personell som jobber, har jobbet og som har kommet tilbake til MTB-våpenet i tillegg til de ansattes familie. Intervjuene har gitt mange interessante forslag til tiltak, samtidig som en god del av tiltakene har vært like for de ulike intervjugruppene. Spesielt med hensyn til mentorarbeid, forutsigbarhet, informasjonsbehov og vedlikehold.
For å bedre kunne forstå hvorfor en stadig økende prosentandel ikke finner jobbtilbudet i MTB-våpenet attraktivt, har vi også sett til sivile konkurrerende rederier sitt jobbtilbud, noe som har gitt oss bedre innsikt i hvorvidt gresset faktisk er grønnere på den andre siden. Det viser seg at spesielt innenfor forutsigbarhet og turnusordninger har MTB-våpenet lite å stille opp med sammenlignet med sivile konkurrerende rederier. Det MTB-våpenet derimot scorer 
høyt på er personlig utvikling, miljø, opplevelsen av samfunnsnytte, og spenning i hverdagen for den ansatte. Dette er viktige faktorer for mange, og faktorer som ledelsen må fortsette å opprettholde og fokusere på.

Ein har då berre ei kronologisk og narrativ historie basert på hendingar. Altså ei historie basert på kortvarige og sporadiske manifestasjonar av dei underliggande strategiske strukturar styrt av dei geografiske røyndomar menneskja og statane eksisterer og verkar i. Ei slik historie kan ikkje forklare kvifor ein hadde sjømakt, korleis den var bygd opp og til kva føremål, og heller ikkje korleis den påverka røyndomen den eksisterte i. Det historiske medvitet om Austersjøregionen som eit operasjonsområde dominert av det maritime er dårleg utvikla. Krigs og militærhistorie, som omhandlar regionen i tidleg moderne tid, tenderer til å vere splitta i ei studiar av landkrig eller sjøkrig, medan heilskapen, dei militære operasjonane og deira strategiske og geografiske føresetnadar, manglar. Dette har hindra oss frå å utvikle ei forståing av at krig i Austersjøregionen i høg grad vart styrt av regionen sin maritime karakter og at den aktør som faktisk etablerte kontroll med og utnytta dei maritime kommunikasjonane best, vanlegvis også var den som kom sigrande ut av krigane. Mi målsetjing med denne oppgåva er difor å klårgjere dei strategiske føremåla og føresetnadane for dei skandinaviske sjømaktene, altså rasjonale bak sjømakta. Eg har nytta sjømaktsteori og ei geostrategisk vinkling for å identifisera dei mest vesentlege faktorane, strukturane og utviklingstrekka. Framstillinga er delt opp i analyser av geografi, politisk- strategisk historie, styrkestrukturar og bruk av sjømakt. Gjennom ei slik tilnærming meiner eg å ha lagt eit betre grunnlag for ei retteleg forståing av sjømakta si påverknad og rolle i Skandinavia si politiske historie i tidleg moderne tid.",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2406096","nno","Universitetet i Bergen","Forfatteren",,"VDP::Humanities: 000::History: 070::Recent history (before 1800): 082",,"Sjømakt||Sjøkrig||Danmark-Norge||Militærgeografi||Sjømaktsteori||Geostrategi||Orlogsskip||Krigshistorie||Maktpolitikk||Østersjøen","Ei historisk-strategisk analyse av skandinavisk sjømakt, 1522-1814","Master thesis"
